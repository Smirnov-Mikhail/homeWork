Millions of people around the world use the Internet every day
I have the internet at home and enjoy looking for useful information for me
Internet is very useful because it is a huge base of data and knowledge
where you can find any thing you want from movies and music of interest to the vast number of books
newspapers and magazines Internet helps to learn lots
To find more information download the required essay
watch video about some books which you have already read
everything can be done through the Internet
Email is one of the advantages of the Internet
This online service is cheaper than regular mail and it works much faster
You never lose touch with loved ones, wherever they are using such mean of communication
I have a personal e-mail and have an opportunity to chat with my friends from other cities and countries
Nowadays there are very different popular social networks where communication with your friends and relatives also is not difficult
Today there are many different Internet competitions for different subjects which give students the opportunity to participate even
in international competitions
On the other hand I think that the Internet  becomes a way of a person life and it is very harmful for our health
Many teenagers spend a long of time sitting at the  computers and spoiling themselves eyes
I do not mean that I am against the Internet but it should have  reasonable limits
